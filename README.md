# Patient-Mortality-Prediction
A deep neural network model designed to provide an analytic framework that medical professionals can use to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. 
Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions, or raise early warning signs to flag at-risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.

The data used was provided by Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).
