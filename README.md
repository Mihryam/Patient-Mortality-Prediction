# Patient-Mortality-Prediction
A deep neural network model designed to provide an analytic framework that medical professionals can use to predict patient mortality at any time of interest. 
Such a solution provides essential feedback to clinicians when trying to assess the impact of treatment decisions, or raise early warning signs to flag at-risk patients in a busy hospital care setting.

The data used was provided by Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA).


Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of patient medical information that can:

Save valuable time when an emergency arises
Eliminate unnecesary treatment and tests
Prevent potentially life-threatening mistakes
Improve the overall quality of care a patient receives when seeking medical assistance

Datasets were stored in HDF5 formats. HDF5 tands for "hierarchical data format version number 5". The HDF format is designed specifically to store and organize large amounts of scientific data and was originally designed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
